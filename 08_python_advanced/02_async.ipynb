    "**Asynchronous web scraping** allows you to send multiple HTTP requests concurrently without blocking the execution of the program. This is ideal for I/O-bound tasks like scraping many web pages, as it enables the program to process multiple requests at once, reducing total scraping time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event Loop**: Manages asynchronous tasks, allowing one task to run while others wait.\n",
    "- **Non-blocking I/O**: HTTP requests don't block the program; it continues to send more requests or process other tasks while waiting for responses.\n",
    "- **Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def` that can be paused and resumed.\n",
    "- **`await`**: Pauses a coroutine until a result is available, such as the response from an HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import aiohttp\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fetch(url):\n",
    "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",
    "        async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
    "            return await response.text()\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    urls = [\"http://example.com/page1\", \"http://example.com/page2\"]\n",
    "    tasks = [fetch(url) for url in urls]\n",
    "    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n",
    "    for result in results:\n",
    "        print(f\"Fetched {len(result)} characters\")\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Scrapes multiple pages concurrently, reducing total time.\n",
    "2. **Low Resource Usage**: Uses a single thread, consuming less memory and CPU.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Handles large volumes of data without the overhead of multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rate Limiting**: Respect website rate limits to avoid getting blocked.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper handling for failed requests and timeouts."
