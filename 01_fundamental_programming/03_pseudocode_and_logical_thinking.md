## **Introduction to Pseudocode and Logical Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
**Pseudocode** is a way of writing algorithms in plain English mixed with programming-like structures. It **doesn’t follow the syntax of a real programming language** but helps programmers plan their logic before writing actual code.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is pseudocode?** – A human-readable way to describe algorithms.  
2. **Basic pseudocode syntax (Variables, Loops, Conditionals).**  
3. **How pseudocode translates into real programming languages.**

### **Example:**  
**Pseudocode for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
```
BEGIN  
   INPUT number  
   IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN  
      PRINT "Even"  
   ELSE  
      PRINT "Odd"  
   ENDIF  
END  
```
