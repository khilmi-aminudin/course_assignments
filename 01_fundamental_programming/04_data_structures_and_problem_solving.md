## **Introduction to Data Structures and Problem Solving**  
### **Introduction:**  
Data structures help organize and store data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure is essential for solving problems effectively in software development.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What are data structures?** â€“ Ways to store and manage data.  
2. **Lists, arrays, and dictionaries.**  
3. **Sorting and searching algorithms.**  
4. **Problem-solving strategies using data structures.**

### **Example:**  
**Problem: Find the largest number in a list.**  
**Algorithm:**  
1. Start  
2. Define a list of numbers  
3. Assume the first number is the largest  
4. Loop through the list and compare each number  
5. If a number is larger than the current largest, update it  
6. Print the largest number  
7. End
